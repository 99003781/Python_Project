# Requirements
## Introduction
 In this project we extract the data which is present in multiple sheets of excel file and search whole data about the paticular parameter given by the user and write that data into same file but in different sheet(like in this case it is named as mastersheet)  

## Defining Our System
    Python analysis tool is used:
    1. Take all the sheets present in single excel file 
    2. Extract the data based on used input from all the files 
    3. Save the data into mastersheet, in same excel file

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
**All financial dataset or any other dataset which contains large amount of data can be extracted based on the requirement.** 

## What:

**There are already so many softwares which extract data that exist in the market. Few of the softwares can extract data based on some specific condition**

## When:

**It can be used to extract large chunks of data  so that manual data extraction work is reduced**

## Where:

**It can be used in Finance Industry, Automobile indutry for deep learning and universities where you need to find out particular student information**

## How:

**By the help of necessary functions provided by the python so that master sheet is created automatically using python code and required information is printed in the mastersheet**
